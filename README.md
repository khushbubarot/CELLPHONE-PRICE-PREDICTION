# CELLPHONE-PRICE-PREDICTION
Cellphone Price Prediction

üîç Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting cellphone prices using machine learning techniques. It involves collecting data on various features of cellphones (such as brand, model, specifications, and condition) and using this data to build a predictive model that estimates the market price of a cellphone.

üìä Key Features:

Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset that includes features such as brand, model, RAM, storage, camera quality, and condition.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features influencing cellphone prices to improve model performance.
Model Building: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms (such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods) to predict cellphone prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
üîß Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
üöÄ Goals:

To develop a robust model that provides accurate price predictions for cell phones.
To explore the impact of different features on cellphone pricing and identify key value drivers.
To create a user-friendly interface or API for querying the model and obtaining price predictions.
